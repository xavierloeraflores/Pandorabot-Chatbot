## Pandorabot Platform Strengths and Weaknesses

### Strengths

- The platform provides a web interface for creating and editing AIML files.
- The platform simulates the chatbot within a chat environment for testing inputs and responses.
- There exists GitHub integration for version control allowing users to use Git to backup their work.

For the most part, the platform strengths allow developers to work entirely within the Pandorabot platform so long as they are comfortable with the code editor. The platform also provides a chat environment for testing the chatbot which is useful for testing the chatbot's responses. The GitHub integration is also useful for version control and backup purposes.

### Weaknesses

- The integration with GitHub isn't perfect since pushing to a git repository will automatically delete any files not included within the Pandorabot workspace such as markdown files and images.
- The code editor is very basic and doesn't provide any robust error messages or auto-completion.
- The platform doesn't support uploading or viewing files types such as .md .pdf and .txt.

While a developer could potentially work entirely from within the Pandorabot editor, it is not ideal. There are several key developer experience features that come with developing natively on device that allow developers to have more control over their projects. Features such as choosing which files to commit to a git repository, having a more robust code editor, supporting more file types are important for developer experience.
